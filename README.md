# java + hellosign = jellosign
When trying to figure out an API or a new piece of code, sometimes seeing it in action is the best way to learn how it works.

This project contains some JSPs that demonstrate how to use the official [HelloSign Java SDK](https://github.com/HelloFax/hellosign-java-sdk) to add document signing, requesting, and template creation to your website.

## Make it go!
To run this demo locally, you'll need [git](https://git-scm.com/), [gradle](https://gradle.org/), [java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html), and [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).

1. Start ngrok to create a tunnel to your localhost on port 8080:

    ```
    ngrok http 8080
    ```
    
    This command will give you a forwarding address which we'll be using below.
    
    ```
    Forwarding http://YOUR_NGROK_HOST.ngrok.io -> localhost:8080
    ```

2. Create an [API app configuration](https://www.hellosign.com/oauth/createAppForm) and enter your app details:
    1. Associated domain name: `ngrok.io`
    2. Event callback url: `https://<YOUR_NGROK_HOST>.ngrok.io/hello`
    3. (Optional) OAuth callback url: `https://<YOUR_NGROK_HOST>.ngrok.io/oauthDemoCallback.jsp`

3. Fork, then clone this repository.

4. Set environment variables by creating a gradle.properties based on the included gradle.properties.sample file.

5. Start a Jetty using gradle container using the maven command:

    ```
    ./gradlew appRun
    ```

6. Open a web browser and point it to: `http://<YOUR_NGROK_HOST>.ngrok.io`

7. Go wild!

## Handling callback events
Take a look at  [ExampleCallbackServlet.java](src/main/java/com/hellosign/sdk/callback/ExampleCallbackServlet.java) to see an example of handling callback events in Java. This servlet will be initialized when jetty starts and is configured in [web.xml](src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml).
